# Program-that-Automates-House-Credit-Inference-for-Bank-Officers-Using-Fuzzy-Logic-Techniques
In this project, a fuzzy logic system that determines the housing credit amount of a bank customer using some features of the relevant residence and some information about the bank customer for bank officials, is developed on Matlab.
Parameters such as the market value of the house, its location, the bank's client's income and income will be crisp inputs to be transferred to the system via membership functions.
As a result, it will automatically calculate the housing credit amount that a bank official calculates manually by making a stable inference through this system. As the fuzzy inference technique made here, "Mandani Inference method" is used.
In addition, the Fuzzy Inference System (Fis) tool-kit in matlab was used for the relevant membership values.
